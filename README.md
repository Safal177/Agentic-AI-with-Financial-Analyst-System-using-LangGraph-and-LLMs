# Project Label:
Financial Analyst ReAct Agentic AI System Using LangGraph and LLMs

# Mission Statement:
The key objective of this project is to make an Agentic AI pipeline and then use it. It has some features:
•	Working as a financial advisor for company stock inquiries
•	Applying ReAct (Autonomous agent) reasoning
•	Collecting and then examining present stock market metrics
•	Generating unambiguous recommendations for investors
•	Presenting advanced expertise in LLM operational handling with Agentic AI, and prompt engineering

# Technical Components:
•	Google Colab (Python programming language)
•	Large Language Models (LLMs)
•	Natural Language Processing (NLP) Methods
•	OpenBB terminal 
•	LangGraph
•	ReAct pipeline
•	Prompt engineering
•	Yahoo finance for financial market data collection

# Key Features:
•	ReAct focused Agentic AI architecture
•	Scalable query understanding
•	Context focused decision paths
•	Context oriented financial toolset
•	Understandable summaries and recommendations

# Final Remarks:
This project clearly shows how to make end-to-end AI system architecture used industry-grade application domains. This system is usable in financial analytics involved in Agentic AI with LLMs, goal oriented (ReAct) reasoning, and live market data fusion. Top keys of this project include:
